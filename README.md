## Programming languages that we used in this project

* * * 
### We built this website with HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, PHP en MySQL

### _**HTML5** and **CSS** are standart programming language to build a "website". We used **JavaScript** for syntax highlighting and switching between dark and light mode. **PHP** & **MySQL** for backend of our website. **PHP** for example we used if for connecting to database and sending the user input to database with the help of **MySQL**. **MySQL** is a database where we store the user input and get the data also to display to use when he want to access it._

## Packages
* * * 
* **CodeMirror**
### We used the Package called **CodeMirror** to implement syntax highlighting. It makes it a lot easier to apply a functionality to switch between programming language based on users choice. You can check it out via [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net "CodeMirror")

## Installation
* * * 
### First run the **SQL** queries in your **MySQL** database and put the whole folder in your htcdocs. Then you can open it via Localhost.
